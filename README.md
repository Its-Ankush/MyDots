**So keep these things in mind**
- The most important thing is if you see the fonts are too small or havent scaled - you need to use the .Xresources and set your DPI [If you have a high DPI screen]
- You need to install i3 gaps from here - https://lottalinuxlinks.com/how-to-build-and-install-i3-gaps-on-debian/
- Now before adding any transparency make sure to install picom https://github.com/yshui/picom
- Install your favourite terminal emulator - here I have used alacritty - https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty [the gnome terrminal is horrible so don't use that]
- Like I said if you want to do the blur/transparent effect on the i3-bar and the terminal make sure to execute picom before you add those colors [I already did that so you have to follow along]
- For the i3 status - I am using bumblebee - https://github.com/tobi-wan-kenobi/bumblebee-status
- Ofcourse you need to install awesome terminal fonts and powerline fonts else it will look ugly as hell.
- You can install lxappearance and then maybe switch over to some other themes after you have installed them based on your preference
- Not sure if I did the right thing to upload .fonts since you can already download that and set it yourlsef
- Also install suckless tools [dmenu] to be able to find programs

Have a nice day
